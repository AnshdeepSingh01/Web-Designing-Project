            <h2>About the Wonder</h2>
            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is known for its sophisticated dry-stone construction and panoramic views. Hidden high in the misty Andes Mountains of Peru, Machu Picchu is one of the most mesmerizing archaeological wonders in the world. Often called the "Lost City of the Incas," this ancient site embodies mystery, beauty, and the incredible ingenuity of the Inca civilization. With its panoramic mountain vistas and remarkably preserved stone architecture, Machu Picchu is a dream destination for history lovers, trekkers, and spiritual seekers alike. Machu Picchu was built in the mid-15th century, around 1450, during the reign of Inca emperor Pachacuti. Despite being abandoned less than 100 years later during the Spanish conquest, it was never discovered by the invaders. As a result, it remained untouched for centuries, hidden by thick jungle and clouds until it was brought to international attention by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.

While its exact purpose remains a subject of debate, Machu Picchu may have served as a royal estate, a religious site, or a ceremonial retreat. Its secluded location and advanced construction techniques suggest that it held significant importance to the Inca elite.</p>
